# Lab 8 - Starter

1. You would include your unit tests in a Github action that runs whenever you push your code. That way, testing is completely automated and you won't build something that is broken. 
2. No. Not directly at least. E2E testing is intended to emulate actions a user might do with your web application to see if it works correctly. This doesn't really directly test the output of a specific function but it can direct you to find a faulty function.
